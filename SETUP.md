This guide will help you get AI Video Pro up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or yarn

5. Click "Create Bucket"

#### D. Update Environment Variables

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "API"
2. Copy your Project URL and anon/public key
3. Update the `.env` file in your project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Create Your First Account

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist` folder ready for deployment.

## Deploying to Production

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Option 2: Netlify

```bash
npm run build
# Drag and drop the dist folder to Netlify
```

### Option 3: Any Static Host

Build the project and upload the `dist` folder to your hosting provider.

**Important:** Make sure to set the environment variables on your hosting platform.

## Enabling Real AI Generation

To connect real AI providers:

### 1. Get API Keys

Sign up for accounts with your chosen providers:
- [Runway ML](https://runwayml.com)
- [Kling AI](https://klingai.com)
- Veo 3 (Google)
- Seadance

### 2. Add API Keys to Environment

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_RUNWAY_API_KEY=your_runway_key
VITE_KLING_API_KEY=your_kling_key
VITE_VEO3_API_KEY=your_veo3_key
VITE_SEADANCE_API_KEY=your_seadance_key
```

### 3. Update AI Service

Modify `src/services/aiGenerationService.ts` to call the actual AI provider APIs instead of the mock service.

### 4. Deploy Edge Functions

The webhook handler is ready in `supabase/functions/ai-webhook/index.ts`. Deploy it using the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-webhook
```

### 5. Configure Webhooks

In each AI provider's dashboard, set the webhook URL to:
```
https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-webhook
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** Can't sign up or login
**Solution:** Check that your Supabase URL and anon key are correct in `.env`

### Upload Fails

**Problem:** Files fail to upload
**Solution:**
1. Verify the `media` storage bucket exists in Supabase
2. Make sure the bucket is set to Public
3. Check file size limits (Supabase free tier has a 50MB limit per file)

### Timeline Not Showing Clips

**Problem:** Clips don't appear on timeline
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the database migration ran successfully
3. Ensure Row Level Security policies are in place

### Video Player Shows Black Screen

**Problem:** Video player doesn't show content
**Solution:**
1. Check that video URLs are publicly accessible
2. Verify CORS is enabled on video sources
3. Check browser console for CORS errors

## Support

For issues and questions:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all setup steps were completed
3. Check that the Supabase project is active
4. Review the README.md for additional documentation

## Next Steps

- Add your own AI provider integrations
- Customize the UI theme and branding
- Implement video export/rendering
- Add more timeline features (transitions, effects)
- Build collaboration features

Enjoy creating AI-powered videos!
